# DSharpPlus.Commands
A new future command handler.

## Notes
Everything seen here is still prototyping and in discussion.

All discussions are current held in this [thread](https://discord.com/channels/379378609942560770/1122664957515923557).   
You can access it through the [DSharpPlus](https://discord.gg/dsharpplus) discord.

This is also trying to merch DSharpPlus.UnifiedCommands (from [Instellate's](https://github.com/Instellate/DSharpPlus) fork) and DSharpPlus.CommandAll (from [Lunar's](https://github.com/OoLunar/DSharpPlus.CommandAll) package).  
So all discussions normally circulate on how to make these packages design's better and more user friendly. Please take a look at both if you are planning on helping with this branch.
